            <h1 id="heading">STUDY BACKGROUND</h1>
            <p id="description">The relationship between a country's economy, college course specialization, and an individual's income has long been a subject of interest and concern in the fields of economics and education. Understanding how these factors interconnect is essential in addressing income disparities, guiding educational policies, and helping individuals make informed career choices.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Context:
                A country's economic condition, often measured by metrics such as GDP per capita, unemployment rates, and inflation, plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals' income levels. In economically prosperous nations, individuals may have better access to well-paying job opportunities, while in economically challenged countries, income disparities may be more pronounced. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the impact of a nation's economic landscape on personal income.
                <br>
                <br>
                Educational Choices:
                College course specialization is a significant determinant of an individual's future career path and earning potential. The choice of major can influence access to various industries and professions, each with its own income prospects. For instance, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields often lead to higher-paying jobs, while some liberal arts and social sciences fields may offer more modest incomes. Understanding how these educational decisions affect income is essential for students and educators.
                <br>
                <br>
                Income Disparities:
                Income disparities within and between countries are well-documented and continue to be a subject of public debate. These disparities often have complex roots, encompassing factors like education, social mobility, and the overall economic climate. A comprehensive understanding of how a nation's economy and educational choices intersect to produce these disparities is crucial for addressing income inequality effectively.
                <br>
                <br>
                Regional and Cultural Variations:
                The relationship between a country's economy, educational choices, and income is not uniform across the globe. Regional and cultural factors can significantly impact the correlation. Variations may arise from differences in education systems, job markets, and societal values, making it essential to consider these nuances in the study.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy Implications:
                This study is of particular importance to policymakers, educators, and students. By uncovering the mechanisms that link economic factors and educational choices to personal income, policymakers can develop more effective strategies to promote equitable economic growth and access to educational opportunities.
                <br>
                <br>
                In light of the intricate relationship between a country's economy, college course specialization, and personal income, our study by ninth-grade students Julius, Yael, and Takki aims to contribute valuable insights to this field. We will employ statistical analysis to explore these connections, providing a foundation for informed decision-making in education, career planning, and public policy.</p>
