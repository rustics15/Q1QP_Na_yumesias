            <p>In the first half of the analysis (Avg. Annual Income,) we see that the top 2 highest average annual income individuals are from Monaco and Bermuda. They are miles apart from the rest of the countries listed. This is represented best through the box and whisker plot, it shows that Monaco and Bermuda are outliers. The entire data set is positively skewed, which tells us that most of the data points are on the lower end. From this, we can conclude that high-income individuals stay in the countries within range. The extreme top half, or who we call “filthy rich” stay in Monaco / Bermuda.

                In the second half of the analysis, we have the US and China insanely high up on the scale of GDP. They are the top 2 outliers based on the box and whisker plot, telling us that they have a great GDP. The data set is positively skewed which means that most of the data points are on the lower end. This says a lot, because the outliers of the last graph aren’t the same with the outliers of the GDP graph. A conclusion can be drawn from that.

                Most of the countries have a Mixed Economic system, and it is shown in both the pie chart and the bar graph. A total of 27 countries have this economic system. It is evident that this is the system that works for the majority of the countries.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most popular college course among the 50 countries  is engineering, and that is shown through the pie chart and the bar graph. A total of 13 countries specialize in engineering. From this, we can draw that the Engineering industry is a well paying one.
